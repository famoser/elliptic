# Testing

The testing is done across multiple dimensions:
- Correctness: Check whether the implementation is correct, notably in relation to math sanity checks and third-party test vectors.
- Hardened: Check whether the implementation might leak the private key to an adversary over side-channels, notably by assessing constant-time execution.
- Speed: Check how fast the essential operations are executed on the curve.

The implementation is in PHP, using the GMP extension for the big-number-math. This inherently limits what is possible in terms of hardening and performance. If these are of prime concern, switch to a mature implementation closer to the metal (e.g. `openssl`).



## Correctness

Overview:
- 100% branch coverage (some exceptions apply around string functions and match statements)
- Math soundness tests (e.g. G*order = 0)
- Math baseline tests (i.e. comparing hardened math output to baseline math)
- Third-party integration tests 

Result:
- Over every curve and on every math, all these tests are executed successfully
- Exception: Math soundness tests of `TwED_ANeg1_Math` and `MG_TwED_ANeg1_Math` fail (but integration tests succeed)
- Exception: Third-party integration tests of `MG_ED_Math` fail (hence `curve448Edwards` remains untested, too)


### Third-Party Integration tests

There are two kinds of integration tests at the moment:
- The `WycheProof` integration tests from [C2SP/wycheproof](https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof). It aims to explore edge cases in implementations, both on the crypto primitive layer (which we do not care about), but also on the elliptic curve math layer (which we do care about). The project seems to be [abandoned)(https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof/issues/113#issuecomment-2610184843), and the original maintainer started a new project called [Rooterberg](https://github.com/bleichenbacher-daniel/Rooterberg).
- The `Rooterberg` integration tests from [bleichenbacher-daniel/Rooterberg](https://github.com/bleichenbacher-daniel/Rooterberg). Same target as `WycheProof` by the same original maintainer.

We choose which testset to execute as follows, mainly to ease maintenance:
- We prefer `WycheProof` over `Rooterberg`, as the latter is still experimental, and its file format might change. 
- We prefer the testset as closest to the elliptic curve as possible (i.e. we prefer `ecdh_ecpoint` over `ecdh` over `ecdsa`)

It holds that:
- Over every curve and on every math, at least one full testset is executed
- Exception: Test of `MG_ED_Math` fails (hence also `curve448Edwards` remains untested)

## Hardened

Overview:
- The implementation is written in PHP and uses GMP for the large-number math. **Neither give any side-channel-free guarantees.**
- The implementation carefully follows RFCs and standards, and hence the algorithms themselves do not trivially introduce side-channels.
- Constant time behaviour, notably corresponding to crafted inputs, is assessed using tests.
- Besides constant time, no other side-channel is explicitly tested for (e.g. caching, power).

Results:
- The implementations are not constant time for crafted inputs (e.g., multiplying by the zero-point). This is likely due to GMP optimizations.
- The hardened implementations perform better (i.e., adversary needs more accurate measurements to detect const-time violations).



## Speed




## Side-channels

To test for side channels, we check whether the following distributions are equal: a) multiplying with a constant value and b) multiplying with always a different random value. The details are documented in the jupiter lab file at `tests/consttime/analyse.ipynb`. 

The results are as follows:
- `SWUnsafeMath` is not const time (as expected)
- `SW_ANeg3_Math` is const time for a reasonable same size (tested with 1000 samples)
- `SW_QT_ANeg3_Math` cannot be shown to be const time, likely because the inversion operation of GMP is not const time (inversion is needed when applying the twist)

There are more tests pending, see [here](https://github.com/bleichenbacher-daniel/Rooterberg/issues/2) for a discussion on the topic.

## Open Questions

Correctness:
- In the JacobiCoordinator, how to handle a non-invertible Z properly? (and in the bilinear mappings)
- In the Coordinators, how to detect/handle infinity?
- Reducing factors before montgomery ladder; correct to reduce by N*h?
- MG_ED math is wrong; "better" if cofactor is set to 1. Why & what could be the problem?
- When recovering a point, use jacobi symbol to check for square root (beforehand), or check xÂ² = alpha (afterwards)?

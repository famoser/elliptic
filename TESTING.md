# Testing

The testing is done across multiple dimensions:
- Correctness: Ensure the implementation is correct, notably in relation to third-party test vectors.
- Side-channels: Check for side-channels, and estimate whether the implementation leaks the private key to a "realistic" attacker. 
- Speed: Compare the speed of the individual implementations. The target is not to optimize the code further (if performance is of prime concern, use an implementation closer to the metal, not PHP); but to show the performance / safety trade-off between the different curve and math choices.


## Correctness

Status:
- 100% branch coverage (some exceptions apply around string functions and match statements)
- Math soundness tests (e.g. G*order = 0)
- Math baseline tests (i.e. comparing hardened math output to baseline math)
- Third-party integration tests

Correctness exceptions:
- `MG_ED_MathTest` outputs different results than the baseline (i.e. is wrong)
- `TwED_ANeg1_Math` and `MG_TwED_ANeg1_Math` do not cycle as expected (i.e. G*order != 0)


### Third-Party Integration tests

There are two kinds of integration tests at the moment:
- The `WycheProof` integration tests from [C2SP/wycheproof](https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof). It aims to explore edge cases in implementations, both on the crypto primitive layer (which we do not care about), but also on the elliptic curve math layer (which we do care about). The project seems to be [abandoned)(https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof/issues/113#issuecomment-2610184843), and the original maintainer started a new project called [Rooterberg](https://github.com/bleichenbacher-daniel/Rooterberg).
- The `Rooterberg` integration tests from [bleichenbacher-daniel/Rooterberg](https://github.com/bleichenbacher-daniel/Rooterberg). Same target as `WycheProof` by the same original maintainer.

We choose which testset to execute as follows, mainly to ease maintenance:
- We prefer `WycheProof` over `Rooterberg`, as the latter is still experimental, and its file format might change. 
- We prefer the testset as closest to the elliptic curve as possible (i.e. we prefer `ecdh_ecpoint` over `ecdh` over `ecdsa`)

It holds that:
- Over every curve and on every math, at least one full testset is executed
- Exception: Test of `MG_ED_Math` fails (hence also `curve448Edwards` remains untested)

## Timing tests

To test for side channels, we check whether the following distributions are equal: a) multiplying with a constant value and b) multiplying with always a different random value. The details are documented in the jupiter lab file at `tests/consttime/analyse.ipynb`. 

The results are as follows:
- `SWUnsafeMath` is not const time (as expected)
- `SW_ANeg3_Math` is const time for a reasonable same size (tested with 1000 samples)
- `SW_QT_ANeg3_Math` cannot be shown to be const time, likely because the inversion operation of GMP is not const time (inversion is needed when applying the twist)

There are more tests pending, see [here](https://github.com/bleichenbacher-daniel/Rooterberg/issues/2) for a discussion on the topic.

## Open Questions

Correctness:
- In the JacobiCoordinator, how to handle a non-invertible Z properly? (and in the bilinear mappings)
- In the Coordinators, how to detect/handle infinity?
- Reducing factors before montgomery ladder; correct to reduce by N*h?
- MG_ED math is wrong; "better" if cofactor is set to 1. Why & what could be the problem?
- When recovering a point, use jacobi symbol to check for square root (beforehand), or check xÂ² = alpha (afterwards)?
